In the above example, we are using bitmap of dimension 16 pixel width and 12 pixel height. For example, converting hexadecimal number 0xc0,0x00 at the bottom (for the first row) gives 1100 0000 0000 0000 meaning the 1st and 2nd pixels are colored , the rest ignored; Similarly remaining 11 rows created.
